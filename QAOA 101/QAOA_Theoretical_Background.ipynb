    "Coming back to our example from just now, trying to optimize y while controlling x thus we are looking for a function f\n",
    "which generates a solution y as y = f(x). The key assumption of any attempt at optimization is the existence of an\n",
    "optimal solution. Alternatively a solution which is sufficiently optimal, generally called $\\hat{y}$. But how do we know\n",
    "how good our solution is? We need to figure out how close it is to the theoretical optimal solution, for this we need a\n",
    "cost function also known as the loss function or simply the loss which we try to minimize\n",

    "A cost function can take many different shapes which depend on the number of parameters, application etc. a general way\n",

    "To make the transition to quantum mechanics, we have to find a way to encode the loss function in a quantum mechanical\n",

    "The whole algorithm looks as follows now. At each optimization step we measure the state of our parametrized circuit. The measurement results in a distribution of probabilities. To evaluate the corresponding energy (that is the cost) we scale the energy for each bitstring that we measured with its probability. And take the average finally. A classical optimizer now tries to minimize this energy by updating parameters of our circuit. As we will see later the role of the optimizer becomes quite crucial. After updating the parameters, we again measure our quantum state. And so on until our optimizer lands in an optimal solution."
