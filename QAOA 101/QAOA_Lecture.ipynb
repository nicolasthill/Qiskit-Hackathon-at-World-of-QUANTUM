    "There are many possible optimizations to QAOA - some which have only been recently introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "One idea is to choose the starting point in a smart way by precomputing the rotation angles.\n",
    "Another improvement possibility is to only consider a fraction with the highest probabilities during measurement when computing the energy of samples.\n",
    "An extreme solution would be just to pick up the bitstring with the highest probability and calculate the energy for it. Another idea is so-called warm starting. It essentially means instead of starting with the ground state which is the equal superposition of all states, to pick a state which is closer to the solution. And of course, adjust the mixer Hamiltonian. Now the limiting factor is the device connectivity. When performing the controlled gates between two qubits, which are not directly connected on the actual hardware, the transpiler introduces SWAP-gates which are very costly in terms of runtime. This of course decreases the performance.\n"
