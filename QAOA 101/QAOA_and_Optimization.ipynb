    "Coming back to our example from just now, trying to optimize y while controlling x thus we are looking for a function f\n",
    "which generates a solution y as y = f(x). The key assumption of any attempt at optimization is the existence of an\n",
    "optimal solution. Alternatively a solution which is sufficiently optimal, generally called $\\hat{y}$. But how do we know\n",
    "how good our solution is? We need to figure out how close it is to the theoretical optimal solution, for this we need a\n",

    "A cost function can take many different shapes which depend on the number of parameters, application etc. a general way\n",
    "of writing it is. The simplest example for a cost function is one dimensional meaning we have a curve of which we find\n",
    "the minimum. A tricky situation is non-convex loss function which can lead to being stuck at a local minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the transition to quantum mechanics, we have to find a way to encode the loss function in a quantum mechanical\n",
